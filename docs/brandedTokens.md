# Branded Tokens

A functional explanation is [available on the wiki](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview).

## TFT backing

Each branded token is backed by TFT in a 1:1 ratio.

Let's take TFTEDU as an example.

The issuer of TFTEDU is GAY5NVAB2UPJPL2FCJM6Z7FFNWI4MTHWF52LLUYEXNRY7IEEGZYWJMWK and it has a trustline to TFT, which means it can hold TFT.

If 1 Million TFTEDU tokens are issued, the issuer account needs to hold 1 Million TFT.

It is as such also transparent and verifiable that all TFTEDU in circulation are backed by at least the same amount of TFT.
