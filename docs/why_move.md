# Why move to Stellar

Currently all TFTs are registered on the Rivine blockchain, which was developed a few years back and has proven to run seamlessly. It was the best choice at the moment it was constructed. In the meantime, more advanced payment blockchains have appeared. Out of these, investigation showed that Stellar is compatible with Rivine blockchain, but allows TFT to be more easily exchangeable with other currencies, in a decentralized way.
That is why the option was taken to move to Stellar network anyway.

Stellar is a blockchain network that is focused exclusively on payments and has about the same features as the Rivine blockchain, also using a sustainable consensus mechanism, and proven in the market to run smoothly. Additionally, it contains a mechanism for exchanging decentrally, using trust lines.
Atomic swaps exist in Rivine, but this is only part of what is needed for a DEX.
Implementing the full requirements Rivine would require too much investment (after all, Threefold has still a relatively small team compared to the SW it has to maintain), while we have seen Stellar is a solution on the shelf.

Moreover, the capability to run any IT workload on the Threefold grid allows to secure the Stellar network by having one or more nodes running on it.
