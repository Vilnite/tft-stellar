# Create TFTA on Stellar

The TFTs on TFchain need to be converted into TFTA on Stellar, through the conversion service and used by 3Bot Connect app. 
These TFTAs can then be converted into Stellar TFT tokens through 2 possible paths : 

- Exchange service TFTA to TFT (1:1, so 1 TFTA becomes 1 TFT), under conditions to avoid dumping of tokens. Idea is that TFTA can only be converted after June 1, if the price of the token is higher than 0.15USD + price increase of x% per month. 
- Pay capacity with TFTAs: 
A user can reserve capacity using TFTA in the same way as he can use TFTs. The TFTA will arrive on an escrow account, that will split up the amount over the different farmers that rent out the capacity. 
In the end, farmers will receive TFTs on his wallet, so a 1:1 conversion needs to happen on the escrow account. 
As the escrow account is a central account in the payment reservation process and likely to be targeted by hackers, there is a request to limit as much as possible the tokens residing on an account.
