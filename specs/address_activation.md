# Address activation

Stellar addresses need to be activated and a minimal amount of XLM has to be kept on the account to be active.

To minimize the burdon for TFT holders, the threefoldfoundation will activate accounts for their users.

All very cool but the risk is real that others will abuse this service to activate non TFT related accounts or steal XLM from the foundation by repeatedly having accounts activated after which the Lumens are transferred away.
