# Address activation

Stellar addresses need to be activated and a minimal amount of XLM has to be kept on the account to be active.

To minimize the burdon for TFT holders, the threefoldfoundation will activate accounts for their users.

All very cool but the risk is real that others will abuse this service to activate non TFT related accounts or steal XLM from the foundation by repeatedly having accounts activated after which the Lumens are transferred away.

Activation during the conversion from the Rivine platform can be secured by requiring the Rivine address. Since a Rivine address can be deducted from a Stellar address, this means the requester has the secret and needs it's TFT to be transferred. A check can also be built in that this activation is only done once so repeatedly activating and merging the account to another one is not possible.
