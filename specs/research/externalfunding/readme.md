# External Funding

## Problem

Transaction fees for TFT on the Stellar platform should be paid in Lumen (XLM) and not in TFT.
It is uncomfortable for users to require and purchase Lumen to be able to do TFT transactions.

## Posssible solution

An option is to fund the transactions from the Threefoldfoundation since transaction fees are very low.

An extra option might be that having the Threefoldfoundation fund the Lumen for the transaction fee is paid by the user in TFT so it feels like the transaction fee is actually in TFT.
