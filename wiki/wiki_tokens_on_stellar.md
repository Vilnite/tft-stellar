## Convert TFChain TFT to Stellar TFTA using 3Bot Connect App

TFChain TFTs can only be converted into Stellar TFTAs when the keys used to register these tokens on TFchain are imported into the 3Bot Connect app. 

Once this is done, conversion is simple : close your 3Bot Connect app on your smartphone, open it again by pressing the 3Bot connect icon, click on the Wallet tab below the screen, enter your PIN and then the conversion process starts.

During the conversion it is important NOT to close the app. (if there are locked tokens, it can take a while) !

### TFT, FreeTFT and TFTA on Stellar

There are 3 Threefold tokens defined on the Stellar network : 

#### TFT
TFT is the default token to be used for capacity reservation on the Threefold grid. Users pay for capacity with TFT. The TFTs are paid out to farmers, and a smaller percentage goes to the Threefold Foundation, the non-profit organisation that promotes the development of the grid. 

#### FreeTFT
FreeTFT is free money that can be earned by candidate developers on the Threefold grid, which can be used for exploration of the grid without loosing money on it. 
There are 1000 FreeTFTs that can be requested per 3Bot ID. 
These FreeTFT are not paid out to farmers, but are burned during the reservation process. They are like a coupon and have no long-lasting value. 

#### TFTA
TFTA are the TFT tokens that were previously registered on TFchain, the Threefold in-house built blockchain (using Rivine technology). In other words: if you had TFT before the conversion you will have now TFTA in your wallet.
